Further, the Buyer can also place Orders for undertaking certain tasks on the Platform (“<strong>Tasks</strong>”). </li>

The Platform Services and Delivery Services are collectively referred to as</span><strong> "Services"</strong><span>. For both Platform Services and Delivery Services, S</span><strong>ORDER2 </strong><span>is merely acting as an intermediary between the Merchants and Buyers and/or PDPs and Buyers/Merchants.</span></li>

In case of complaints by the Merchants/Buyers for deficiency or lapse in the delivery services or Task completion services provided by PDP,</span><strong> ORDER2</strong><span> shall notify the same to the PDP and also assist Merchants/Buyers to the best of its abilities to enable satisfactory resolution of the complaint. </span></li>
